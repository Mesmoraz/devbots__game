HOW TO USE AUDIO SCRIPTS

MUSIC
1. Create music scriptable object in the prefabs folder under
scriptable object>>music

2. Add this object under the array of scriptable music objects under the audio manager

3. To call from code, call the function, pass the name of the music as a string

REACTIONARY SOUNDS(UI clicks, Ca-ching sound, fanfares)
1. Create music scriptable object in the prefabs folder under
scriptable object>>Reactionary

2. Add the SoundProducer script onto the object making the sound

Add the required object in the object slot in the script

If you are creating a sound that plays with an animation:
	Call the function PlaySound() from the animation frame

If you want to create the sound through a UI element:
	Call the function PlaySound() from event system

BOT PART SOUNDS
Every bot has a BotAudioManager with the audio source.

Every bot part prefab has a BotPartAudio script and the BotPart base script has a reference to this script on the object.

For now, every bot part can create ONE sound. To call, one must use botPartAudio.PlaySound(); to play the sound. 

The sound is to be loaded as a serialized object of type PartScriptableObject onto the BotPartAudio script.
This object will hold the pitch and audio clip.
